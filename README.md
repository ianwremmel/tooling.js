> tooling.js makes it easier to use nodejs for automation tasks.

Inspired by [Jenkins Pipelines](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) (specifically, the [groovy]() based Jenkinsfile), tooling.js aims to make JavaScript friendlier for writing tooling for software projects.

## Background

Bash is clearly the defacto interpreter for the tasks required for building and testing software projects. However, as projects grow in size, bash can start to get unwieldy: error handling is complex, everything is in global scope, and parallelism requires arcane syntax and dropping state into tmp files.

JavaScript (especially with async/await), on the other hand, makes parallism and error handling loads better than bash. `try/catch` makes error handling reasonable straightforward (certainly easier than spending ten minutes on stack overflow to figure out if you should use `==` or `-eq`).

Of course, to take advantage of some of the most convenient advantes of JavaScript, we need to introduce babel and its requisite plugins - which is fine, but not work that we should repeat in every project we write. Enter tooling.js.

Tooling.js accepts a script file as an argument and passes it through two compilation stages. The second stage simply uses [`babel-present-env`](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env) to ensure that all syntax is compatible with your local node version. The first stage introduces the globals described below.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @ianwremmel/tooling.js
```

or

```bash
npm install --save-dev @ianwremmel/tooling.js
```

> with the save-dev option, you'll want to define your executables with npm scripts.

## Usage

Invoke tooling.js with

```bash
tooling automation.js
```

or

```bash
cat automation.js | tooling
```

In addition to injecting the globals described below, tooling.js wraps your script in an async IIFE, thus allowing you to use the await keyword at the top level of your script.

> Note: Due to the semantics of the `import` and `export`, scripts that use the `export` keyword will *not* be wrapped in an async IIFE and all `import` statements *must* be at the top of the script.

### Examples

#### Run three grunt tasks in parallel

```javascript
parallel(
  sh(`grunt test:unit`),
  sh(`grunt test:node`),
  sh(`grunt test:automation`)
)
```

#### Handle failing shell scripts

```javascript
try {
  sh(`exit 1`)
}
catch (err) {
  if (err.code === 1) {
    echo(`yowzers`);
  }
  else {
    echo(`this should never be reached`);
  }
}
```

#### Handle shell scripts with meaningful error codes

```javascript
const result = sh(`exit $RANDOM`, {complex: true});
if (result.code === 1) {
  echo(`exit with one`)
}
else {
  echo(`did not exit with one`)
}
```

### require-hook

Tooling.js provides a require hook at `@ianwremmel/tooling.js/register`. The following should work:

```bash
node -r @ianwremmel/tooling.js/register automation.js
```

or

```javascript
require(`@ianwremmel/tooling.js/register`);
require(`./automation.js`);
```

### Programmtic API

```javascript
const transform = require(`@ianwremmel/tooling.js`);
eval(transform(require(`./automation.js`)));
```

## API

### node fs functions

All async functions from [`fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) are promisified and automatically prefixed with `await`. `mkdir` is replaced by [mkirp](https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp).

```javascript
const file = readFile(`in.txt`)
```

> `readFile` defaults to utf8 encoding

### cd

Changes the current directory

```javascript
const os = require(`os`);
cd(os.tmpdir());
```

### echo

Shorthand for `console.log`.

```javascript
echo(`1`)
```

### env

Shorthand for `process.env`.

```javascript
env.TEST_VAR = 5;
```

### parallel

Run multiple items in parallel. Note: every argument is wrapped in a promise, so arguments can be anything that can be passed to a function.

#### Options
- concurrency: Number - maximum number of concurrent tasks to execute


```javascript
parallel(
  console.log(1),
  new Promise((resolve) => {
    process.nextTick(() => {
      console.log(2);
      resolve();
    })
  }),
  console.log(3)
);
```

```javascript
parallel({concurrency: 2},
    console.log(1),
    new Promise((resolve) => {
      process.nextTick(() => {
        console.log(2);
        resolve();
      })
    }),
    console.log(3)
);
```

### pwd

prints the current directory when not assigned or returns it when assigned.

#### prints the current directory
```javascript
pwd()
```

#### returns and does not print the current directory
```javascript
const dir = pwd()
```

### readJSON

Reads a file and parses its contents as JSON. Will throw if the file does not contain valid JSON.

```javascript
const json = readJSON(`in.json`);
```

### retry

Execute an expression multiple times.

#### Options
- repeat: Boolean - if true, the expression will be executed max times, even if it succeeds. default: false
- max: Number - maximum number of iterations. default: 3

```javascript
retry(
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reject(new Error(`this will fail 3 times`));
  })
)
```

> Note: rejected Promises *must* be rejected with `Error` objects. This seems to have something to do with babel's async/await support.

```javascript
retry({max: 2, repeat: true}
  new Promise((resolve) => {
    console.log(`this will print twice`);
  })
)
```

The variables ITERATION and MAX_ITERATIONS are injected into the running expression.

```javascript
retry({max: 2, repeat: true}
  new Promise((resolve) => {
    console.log(`{ITERATION} out of ${MAX_ITERATIONS}`);
  })
)
```

> Note: `ITERATION` is zero-based, so will never equal `MAX_ITERATIONS`.

### sh

Execute a shell command "synchronously" (actually wraps `child_process.spawn` in a promise and drops an `await` in front of it).

#### options
- complex: Boolean - if true, return the full object returned by spawn instead of just stdout
- spawn: Object - an object of options to pass directly to [spawn](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options).


```javascript
sh(`echo 1`)
```

```javascript
try {
  sh(`exit 5`);
}
catch(err) {
  require(`assert`).equal(err.code, 5);
}
```

```javascript
const one = sh(`echo 1`, {complex: true}).stdout;
```

## tee

Send stderr/stdout to additional locations.

#### Send stderr and stdout to a single file while continuing to print to the console

```javascript
tee({file: `out.log`, stderr: true, stdout: true});
echo(1);
```

#### Supress output while redirecting stdout and stderr

```javascript
tee({file: `out.log`, stderr: true, stdout: true});
tee.silent = true;
echo(1);
```
> Note: Though it doesn't matter when you sent `tee.silent`, doing so won't have any impact until after tee is called for the first time.

#### Redirect only certain parts of your script

```javascript
echo(1);
const t = tee({file: `out.log`, stderr: true, stdout: true})
echo(2);
t.stop();
echo(3);
```
